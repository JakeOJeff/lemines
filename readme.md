# Lemines Minesweeper AI

A simple minesweeper solving AI!

## What is Special about this?
This solves a minesweeper game similar to how a human would solve it. It starts off by selecting random cells to begin, then working its way and determining which cell to flag next or expand. If it reaches a point where it has two options, it has the ability to guess and pick which one to choose just like a real human! 

This AI doesn't have a 100% win-rate because there reaches a point sometimes in minesweeper where its guess-based.

## How was this built?

I built the minesweeper game first in LuaLove. I then later created and developed the algorithm by brainstorming with a curious person who was interested in what I was doing :D

## How to use?

You can start up the game and then play like normal. You may see some yellow and blue squares.
 - Yellow : What the AI wants to Flag
 - Blue : What the AI wants to click

You can use these guides to place the flags or click the cells or play on your own. If you want AI to run itself, just press **'E'**. It will activate an AI move per press.
